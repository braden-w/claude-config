# Writing Guidelines

## Avoiding AI-Generated Feel

### The Dead Giveaways
- **Bold formatting everywhere**: Biggest red flag. Never bold section headers in post content
- **Excessive bullet lists**: Convert to flowing paragraphs
- **Marketing language**: "game-changing", "revolutionary", "unleash", "empower"
- **Structured sections**: "Key Features:", "Benefits:", "Why This Matters:"
- **Vague superlatives**: "incredibly powerful", "seamlessly integrates", "robust solution"
- **AI adjectives**: "perfectly", "effortlessly", "beautifully", "elegantly"

### Writing Natural Prose
- **Start with a story or problem**: "I was paying $30/month..." not "Introducing..."
- **Use specific numbers**: "$0.02/hour" not "affordable pricing"
- **Personal voice**: "I built this because..." not "This was built to..."
- **Conversational flow**: Ideas connect naturally, not in rigid sections
- **Concrete examples**: "I use it 3-4 hours daily" not "heavy usage"

## Technical Writing Voice

### Core Principles
- **Start with the problem or decision**: "I was building X and hit this decision" not "When building applications..."
- **Show the insight first**: Lead with what you realized, then explain why
- **Use concrete examples**: Show actual code or scenarios, not abstract concepts
- **Make it conversational**: Write like you're explaining to a colleague at lunch

### Avoiding Academic/Corporate Tone
- Don't: "This article explores two architectural approaches..."
- Do: "I hit an interesting architectural decision"
- Don't: "Let's examine the implications"
- Do: "Here's what I mean"
- Don't: "In conclusion, both patterns have merit"
- Do: "The lesson: Not every data access needs a service"

## Punctuation Guidelines

### Avoiding AI Artifacts

The pattern " - " (space-hyphen-space) is a common AI writing artifact. Replace with proper punctuation:

1. **Semicolon (;)**: Connect closely related independent clauses
   - Before: `The code works - the tests pass`
   - After: `The code works; the tests pass`

2. **Colon (:)**: Introduce an explanation, list, or example
   - Before: `**Bold text** - This explains what it means`
   - After: `**Bold text**: This explains what it means`

3. **Em dash**: Dramatic pauses or parenthetical statements (use sparingly)
   - Before: `The app is fast - really fast`
   - After: `The app is fast, really fast`
