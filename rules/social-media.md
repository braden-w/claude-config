# Social Media Post Guidelines

## Platform-Specific Brevity
- **LinkedIn**: 3-5 lines max. State the feature, drop the link, done.
- **Twitter/X**: Each tweet should have ONE idea. Don't overexplain.
- **Reddit technical subs**: Focus on implementation details, not benefits

## What to Remove
- All hashtags except when platform culture expects them
- Section headers in post content ("## Implementation", "## Benefits")
- Bullet lists of features/benefits
- Marketing phrases ("game-changing", "seamless", "powerful")
- Call-to-action phrases ("See it in action!", "Try it today!")
- Redundant adjectives ("excellent", "really")

## What to Add
- Specific technical details that developers care about
- Actual implementation challenges and solutions
- Links to relevant libraries/APIs used
- One unique feature detail ("with your model of choice")
- Disclaimers when recommending tools ("Not affiliated, it just...")
- Personal standards/opinions ("by my standards", "slated for cleanup")
- Formal transitions with proper punctuation (semicolons, periods)

### Good (Focused on Implementation)
```
Hey r/sveltejs! Just shipped a file upload feature for Whispering and wanted to share how I implemented drag-and-drop files.

I used the FileDropZone component from shadcn-svelte-extras, which provided a clean abstraction...

[Technical details about implementation]

You can see the full implementation here (note that the code is still somewhat messy by my standards; it is slated for cleanup!).

Feel free to check it out for more patterns! Not affiliated, it just saved me hours of implementation time.

Happy to answer any questions about the implementation!
```

### Bad (Marketing-Focused)
```
## The Problem
